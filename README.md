# Calculator 

This project is a part of the [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum on programming. This is a final practical [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) that implements all the basic JavaScript concepts learned in the course. 

The calculator includes all the standard functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, calculation interest, flipping the sign and a decimal button.
